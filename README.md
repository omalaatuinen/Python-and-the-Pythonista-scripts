# Python-and-the-Pythonista-scripts
Scripts in the python. Some scripts are for the iOS Pythonista app.

One of my hobbies is making an automations for the iphone, ipad and an apple watch. When i found out, that the Pythonista app has quite a deep access to the iOS functionality, the Python as a programming language got more sense for me to learn. 

The python scripts can be run using the Pythonista's extension. It means, the app's view is not needed, and that means, that the Python scripts can run in a background, so the iPhone's display can be locked. This is a quite a thing! Because, the Pythonista allows making many things, such as getting the gyroscope data, compass, haptic effects, etc, and all of that is ppossible even in a background mode. That's the thing, which makes the python coding language quite interesting.
